## Description
I love music and frequently attend live music shows when I can, however I am sick of going to shows with uncertainty as to who I am seeing. I would like an app that allows me to search by band name, preview their music and see all upcoming events.

## Usage
* When loaded the page will:
    * On the left hand side show a history of your last 5 searches and views.
    * In the central panel introduce and explain the website.
    * On the right hand side show a google map with your location.
* Search for a band by key word.
* View the list of results on the left and listen to 30 second song previews.
* When an artist is clicked on the central panel will display artist information
    * The map will show event location.

The following image demonstrates the application functionality:
