## Description
Scenario 1
* I love music and frequently attend live music shows when I can, however I am sick of going to shows with uncertainty as to who I am seeing. I would like an app that allows me to search by band name, preview their music and see all upcoming events.

Scenario 2
* As a music Promoter I am always looking to spread the word about upcoming gigs and shows. I need an application that allows users to sample various artists and easily figure out where and when these artists are performing.

## Usage
* When loaded the page will display:
    * Search and history on the left hand panel.
    * Information about the website including future development oportunities in the central panel.
    * A Google Map set to your location on the right hand panel.
* To search:
    * Enter a artist/band name and click search or hit the enter key.
    * A list of results will display below the search inputst.
    * Click on an artist to view information about them:
        * The central panel will display an: 
            * Image
            * Genres
            * Ablums
            * Top hits, with 30 second previews
        * The right hand side will show:
            * All upcoming events, when an event is selected the map will move to the event location, and display nearby accomodation:
            * Event information includes:
                * Date
                * Countdown
                * Venue name   
                * Location
                * and ticket purchase location  
            * Note: if there are no upcoming events, the map will default to you location and prove a message explaining there are no upcoming events.
